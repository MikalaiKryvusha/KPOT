# EXPERIENCE — the agent's accumulated experience

> The agent's growing log of lessons. **Externalized memory of *what works and what doesn't*** — so a
> fresh, context-less session (or an autonomous loop) never repeats a dead end. Consult it BEFORE a task;
> append to it AFTER a meaningful attempt (success **or** failure). Grep, don't scroll.
>
> **Tags live inline on every entry** (not in a central list) — so one grep finds the experiences directly:
> `grep '#loop' EXPERIENCE.md` · `grep -i '#context\|#build' EXPERIENCE.md` · `grep '❌' -A4 EXPERIENCE.md`
> · `grep 'EXP-0007' EXPERIENCE.md`. Reuse an existing tag where one fits (grep to see what's in use).
>
> **Entry format (keep it short and grep-friendly).** Newest on top. Every entry starts with a stable id,
> an ISO date, an outcome marker (`✅` / `❌` / `❌→✅`), and inline `#tags`:
>
> ```

> **Context:** one line — what was being done.
> **Tried / did:** the approach, briefly.
> **Result:** ✅/❌ — what happened.
> **Lesson:** the reusable takeaway (the reason this entry exists).   → link: bugs/NN · ideas/NN · plans/NN

## Entries

### EXP-0001 · 2026-01-01 · ✅ · #example #meta
**Context:** first task after KAIF was deployed into this project (example entry — replace with real ones).
**Tried / did:** wrote the first real lesson here in the canonical format.
**Result:** ✅ — the experience log is live and greppable.
**Lesson:** capture lessons at the level of *approach* (what worked / what to avoid), not defect detail
(that lives in `bugs/`); one short entry beats a long story.   → link: (none)
