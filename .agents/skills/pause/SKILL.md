description: SOFT-PARK the current chat — a temporary pause with the intent to CONTINUE IN THIS SAME CHAT. Bring the task in flight to a logical stopping point, verify the tree is green, park neatly WITHOUT the heavy wrap-up (no push, no STATUS/README ceremony) and post a precise parking note in the chat. Use when the human says "pause", "park it", "hold on, back soon", "пауза", "припаркуйся", "прервёмся ненадолго". For the FULL session closure (STATUS, commits, pushes, handoff to other chats) use /end-chat instead. Trigger aliases (ru): «пауза», «сделаем паузу», «припаркуйся», «прервёмся ненадолго»

# /pause — soft-park the chat (we continue HERE later)

A temporary pause, not a goodbye: the human intends to come back to THIS chat and continue. The whole
point is a **cheap, precise parking** — no heavyweight rituals. The heavy closure — `STATUS.md`,
commits, pushes, handing the baton to other agents — is `/end-chat`, a different skill.

## Step 1. Reach a logical stopping point — never park mid-surgery

Finish the smallest coherent unit of the work in flight: the tree must **build green and pass its
checks**. If you are mid-edit and the tree is broken, the parking point is AFTER the minimal set of
edits that makes it green again — say so in the chat and finish that first (minutes, not hours).
Do NOT start anything new.

## Step 2. Preserve the work — locally and lightly

- If the tree is green and carries uncommitted work: make a **local commit without pushing**
  (`wip: <what> — soft parking` + your standard co-author trailer). A local commit costs nothing
  and survives a crash; a push is a session-closure act and belongs to `/end-chat`.
- Do NOT update `STATUS.md`, README or other status documents — that ceremony is exactly what this
  skill exists to skip. The parking note in the chat (step 3) is the continuation medium.

## Step 3. The parking note — the chat IS the memory here

Post one compact note in the chat:
- **Where we stand:** what just got finished and verified (one line per item).
- **Exactly where to resume:** the next concrete action, with file/command names — written so that
  "продолжаем"/"continue" picks up with zero re-derivation.
- Anything time-sensitive the human should know before they leave.

Then stop. No further actions, no background work.

**For KPOT specifically:** "green" in step 1 means `npm test` passes — there is no build step (pure
Node ESM), so `npm run build` does not exist and must not be invented. That is the whole gate for a
soft park; everything heavier (README, `STATUS.md`, the push) belongs to `/end-chat`.

## Notes

- The difference in one line: **/pause = the chat continues later; /end-chat = the chat says goodbye.**
- If the pause unexpectedly becomes permanent (the human never returns to this chat), nothing is
  lost: the local commit holds the work, and the next session's `/resume` reads the tree and
  `git log` as usual.
